pings that can be used for monitoring connectivity.

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------*/

Configuring

Here is an nsd.tcl excerpt for configuring the ICMP module:

ns_section      ns/server/${servername}/module/nsicmp
ns_param	timeout		 2
ns_param	count		 3
ns_param	size		 56
ns_param	sockets	 	 1

sockets is to pre-allocated specified number of raw sockets
for ICMP pings.

    ns_ping host -count n -timeout n -size n -alert 0|1 -debug 0|1 -wait n

      performs ICMP ECHO queries of one host
      where
        -count n specifies to send n ICMP packets
        -timeout n specifies to wait n seconds for reply
        -size n specifies n bytes of data to be sent
        -alert if set to 0 will not fire Tcl exception, will just
               return the result
        -debug is set to 1 will produce log with more info about pings
        -wait defines number of seconds to wait, this is total wait time
        -name can be used to be returned in the reply instead of host, also if at least
              1 name present in parameters, result will include name or host

      returns the following Tcl list:
       { requests_sent requests_received loss_percentage rtt_min rtt_avg rtt_max }


    ns_ping host -alert 0|1 -debug 0|1 -count n -timeout n -size n -wait n -name n ?host -...? ?host -...?

       sends pings to multiple hosts at once. For each host the following
       parameters apply to previous host only. Returns result for each host specified, maximum
       timeout will define the longest execution time of multiple ping.

      returns the following Tcl list of lists:
       { { host|name requests_sent requests_received loss_percentage rtt_min rtt_avg rtt_max } ... }
